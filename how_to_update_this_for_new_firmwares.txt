Steps for updating this tool for newer firmwares:

1. Skip this step unless the unlikely event MSET (system settings) updates AND there's a new aes key (hasn't happened yet in algorithm v2). Get the aes key for US,EU,JP,KR at mset virtual addr. 0x0026b35c, code.bin+0x0016b35c (this version is found in firmwares 11.5-11.16). Paste the 16 bytes to a file named: ctr_aes_0?.bin, where ? is region code: 1=US, 2=EU, 5=KR, 9=JP.

2. While in Godmode9, masterkey.bin is found by navigating to SYSNAND CTRNAND/title/000400db/00017X02/content/000000??.app, then Press A -> Ncch image options -> Mount image to drive -> romfs/masterkey.bin -> Press A -> Copy to 0:/gm9/out. Then find the file in SDMC:/gm9/out/masterkey.bin. This needs to be done for all 4 regions as well. The X in the titleID low (/00017X02/ above) of CVER varies by region. It's not important. You may also use 3Dnus and ctrtool to extract the masterkey.bin. Consult those apps for instructions.

3. Rename masterkey.bin to ctr_XX_YY.bin where XX is the first byte (in hex) in the same file, and YY is the second byte in the file (also hex). Put these 4 renamed files in the data folder and the new firmware should now be supported.


Notes: 
TWN and CHN have horribly outdated msets and thus only use algorithm v0 for all firm versions, which requires no data files.
KOR uses algorithm version v0 up to 9.5 and skips v1 entirely, using v2 for 9.6 to latest.
USA,EUR,JPN use all 3 algorithms as described here: https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/System_Settings#Parental_Controls_Reset
